This is a game created using pygame in Python. 

Press "Enter"  when the selector is on "Play" on the menu screen to play.

Use "arrow keys" to move the block. 

The game features 3 distinct levels, each with its own unique grid layout. As you progress to the next level, the difficulty increases and new obstacles are introduced. Each level also has a time limit.

The main objective is to collect 5 cookies fast as possible to unlock the gate. Once the gate opens, you must reach to the gate before time runs out, while avoiding moving obstacles that can cause you to lose and then you must restart.
